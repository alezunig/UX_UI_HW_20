            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Our task was to redesign a government website with the main focus of implementing responsive web design protocols into the wireframes and prototypes. As people who love the outdoors, we chose the National Park Service website to update the clunky looking user interface and fix some of the current responsive design aspects that don't translate well from desktop to mobile.</p>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Many people visit the National Park Service website for information on parks in the United States. However, the current website lacks a consistent organization system and a cohesive aesthetic, which can hurt a usersâ€™ experience. Our target audience were users looking for information on how to safely visit national parks during the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Our goal in redesigning the National Park Service website was to improve aesthetic appeal and increase usability. This was done through highlighting key information on the landing page, simplifying navigation steps, and re-ordering subpages to make common tasks easier and quicker, all while keeping the main focus on COVID-19 alerts for users.</p>

            <h1>Phase 1: User Research</h1>

        <div class="proto persona">
            <h2>Proto-Persona</h2>
            <p>We began the project by creating a proto-persona; the NPS website already had a user base, which is where we drew our assumptions from. This step was first because we needed to keep a user in mind while designing.

            We filled out our persona completely with the focus being on our users' needs and pain points. With our user established, we were able to keep them in mind throughout the redesign.</p>
